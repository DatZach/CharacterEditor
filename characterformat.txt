=== Notes on Player Name ===
Technicaly the name can be signed int max characters long, however,
	the game has some routine that verifies the names are less than
	or equal to 15 character and some other small attributes and
	panics if it isn't.

=== Notes on Pet Names ===
Pet names can be 15 characters long and are stored as item attributes,
	the material byte being used as the ASCII character.
